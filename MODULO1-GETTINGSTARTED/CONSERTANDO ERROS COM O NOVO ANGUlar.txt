MUST READ:

In the next lecture, we'll create a new Angular project

To ensure that this works, for the moment, make sure that you have the LTS version of NodeJS installed, NOT the latest version (from https://nodejs.org/en/).

Especially double-check that you have npm version 6 installed - it's a tool that's installed together with NodeJS.

We need that tool to install the Angular CLI and create new Angular projects with that CLI.

Since npm v7 can cause issues, you should ensure that you use v6. Therefore, also run npm install -g npm@6 to ensure that you are using that version (on macOS, you might need to add sudo in front of that command).

Thereafter, you can proceed to creating a new Angular project.
