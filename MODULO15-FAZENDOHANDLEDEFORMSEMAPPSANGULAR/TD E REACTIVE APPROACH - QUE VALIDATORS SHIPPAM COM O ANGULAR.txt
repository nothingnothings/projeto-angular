Which Validators do ship with Angular? 

Check out the Validators class: https://angular.io/api/forms/Validators - 


these are all built-in validators, though that are the methods which actually get executed

 (and which you later can add when using the reactive approach).

For the template-driven approach, you need the directives. 

You can find out their names, by searching for "validator" in the official docs:

 https://angular.io/api?type=directive - everything marked with "D" is a directive 
 
 and can be added to your template.

Additionally, you might also want to enable HTML5 validation (by default, Angular disables it).

 You can do so by adding the ngNativeValidate  to a control in your template.













ALGUMAS DAS DIRECTIVES:





<input type="number" ngModel max="4">











MAX 



E MIN...














também temos 'minLength validator' 

e 
'maxLength validator'









-> também 'checkbox required validator'... (talvez usado com USER AGREEMENTS)...









-> também 'pattern validator'..



A directive that adds regex pattern validation to controls marked with the pattern attribute. 
The regex must match the entire control value. The directive is provided with
 the NG_VALIDATORS multi-provider list.














OK, MAS ISSO QUE O PROFESSOR FALOU É INTERESSANTE:
